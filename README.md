# Tic_Tac_Toe_Android_App


## Overview

This is a tic tac toe android app wtih Android Studio in Java. I created all objects: O's, X's, and a table from scratch using Figma.

* Implemented a strong AI with Mini-Max Algorithm.
* Used SharedPreferences (Interface) to store data for checking dark mode and the score counter.
* Used MediaPlayer (Interface) to add sound effects and background music.

## Problems I faced
* It was hard to implement Mini-Max Algorithm since I needed to figure out how to deal with 2 conditions: Player goes first and AI goes first.
* Implementing background music was hard since I had to figure out switching the music depending on appropriate scenes.
* I still have an issue on background music that I can hear some noise in the background. I assume the noise occurs since the background music is overlapped. It is hard to figure out since it's hard to find which part is overlapped.

## Future goal
* I am currently learning Firebase to make a global score counter which players can observe Human’s and AI’s wins.
* I will figure out the background music issue.
